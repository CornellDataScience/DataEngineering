# Data Engineering

## Who we are:
The CDS Data Engineering subteam exists to provide analysis and processing support to CDS project teams, and to develop institutional knowledge in high throughput computing. 

**Advisor:** [Professor Immanuel Trummer](http://www.itrummer.org/)  
**Team Leads:** [Dae Won Kim](https://github.com/dwkwvss) (ORIE MENG), [Haram Kim](https://github.com/haramkim-1) (A&S CS 2020) 

## Team objectives:
* Improve on existing high throughput computing frameworks
* Develop solutions for data analysis problems in CDS projects
* Provide a reservoir of reference information in data engineering
* Research and publish means of improving existing DE frameworks

## Previous Projects:
* [Data streaming](https://github.com/CornellDataScience/DataEngineering/tree/master/archive/kafka_streaming): Profiling of real time data streaming through [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org)

* Server monitoring: Real time visualization and monitoring of compute server resource utilization through [Cockpit](http://cockpit-project.org/)

* [File format optimization and profiling](https://github.com/CornellDataScience/DataEngineering/tree/master/archive/file_formats): Comparative analysis of a variety of file formats typically used in data science, focusing on CSVs and [Apache Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org)

* [Spark diagnostics](https://github.com/CornellDataScience/DataEngineering/tree/master/archive/diagnostics): Deliberate attempts to produce errors while running Apache Spark, both locally and on our servers. Problem specifics and solutions were recorded in case similar issues develop in the future.
